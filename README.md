lynx

An OpenGL game engine.

## lynx-demo

This is just a test environment where I've been playing around with features in development.


## maze demo

I made a simple maze game with this engine within a few hours. It's not included in this repo, but I plan on uploading it soon.

Here's some screenshots from it.
